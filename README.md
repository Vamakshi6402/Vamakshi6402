## 👋 Hi, I’m Vamakshi Chaturvedi

**Economist** | Applied Micro | Data & Policy Analytics | MSc Economics (The University of Manchester)

I’m an economist focused on **decision-making under uncertainty**—pricing and demand analysis, causal impact evaluation, experimentation (A/B testing and power), and forecasting. My work translates complex economic data into clear, **leadership-ready recommendations** for product, marketplace, and operational decisions.

I’ve curated a 40+ story analytical portfolio on Medium, writing on economics, policy, innovation, and global resilience.
